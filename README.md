# TIL (Today I Learned)
This repository contains a collection of things I learn daily as part of my personal and professional growth.

## Why I Resumed
After starting my career, I couldn't keep up with my TIL updates for about a year due to a busy schedule. Now, I'm restarting to gradually build the habit of documenting my learning journey and tracking my progress.
