# Introduction to Kubernetes (K8s)

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source software for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

---

## A Brief History of Kubernetes

- Kubernetes originated as part of **Google Cloud Platform's Project Borg**, which was designed to manage large-scale containerized workloads.
- The name "Kubernetes" comes from the Greek word **"κυβερνήτης"**, meaning **"helmsman"**.
- The abbreviation **"K8s"** represents "Kubernetes" with the middle 8 characters omitted (K + 8 letters + s).
- Kubernetes is often pronounced as "**Kates**."

## Why Kubernetes Matters?

Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications by:
- Automating scaling and deployment.
- Providing self-healing capabilities.
- Offering a unified platform for running applications across hybrid or multi-cloud environments.

A Kubernetes cluster is composed of **Control Plane nodes (CP)** and **Worker nodes**.  
All Kubernetes nodes run two core components:
- **`kubelet`**: Manages the container runtime engine (e.g., CRI-O, containerd). 
- **`kube-proxy`**: Manages networking for containers and controls external communication.

### Control Plane (CP)

The Control Plane is responsible for managing the Worker nodes and the overall state of the cluster. It provides:
- **API Server**: Handles communication between components and exposes the Kubernetes API. It is central to the operation Kubernetes cluster.
- **Scheduler**: Allocates resources to pods and manages workload distribution. Algorithm to determine which node will host a pod of container.
- **Cluster Store**: Stores configuration and state information, typically using etcd.
- **Network Settings**: Manages cluster-wide networking.

> Note: The Control Plane typically does not run application containers.

### Worker nodes 

Worker nodes are the machines where application containers are deployed and run. Their operating system can be either **Linux** or **Windows Server**, depending on the environment and requirements.

Each node can run different container runtime engines, such as:
- **CRI-O**
- **Containerd**

These engines are managed by the `kubelet` component, which ensures that containers are running as defined in the Kubernetes specifications.

For more information about Windows containers in Kubernetes, refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation on Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/).


## Kubernetes term
### Pod
A Pod is composed of one or more containers and shares an IP address, storage, and namespace among its containers. Typically, a Pod contains a single container, but multi-container Pods are also supported when needed.
### namespace
A **namespace** is used as an identifier for Kubernetes objects, providing a scope for names. It helps in the organization and control of resources, especially in multi-tenant environments or when segregating environments like development, staging, and production.

### Init container
An **Init Container** is a special type of container in a Pod that is executed before the primary containers. If an Init Container fails, the primary container(s) will not be started. Init Containers are useful for performing setup tasks or initializing the environment for the primary containers. For example, they can perform administrative or root-level tasks before the main application starts.


Example 
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main-app
    image: databaseD 
  initContainers:
  - name: wait-database
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until ls /db/dir ; do sleep 5; done; '] 
```
This initContainers wait-database that ensure a directory `/db/dir` exists before the main conatiner starts.
